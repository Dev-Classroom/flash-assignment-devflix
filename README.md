## Assignment Overview
For this assignment you'll just need your basic Figma skills. There's a video where we walk you through how to get things set up and create a 'presentation' that you'll use to share your work. First, check the brief below for some guidelines and goals.

## Brief
Your client - DEVFLIX, a multinational development conglomerate that specializes in development parodies of famous movies - has asked you to redesign their logo. DEVFLIX's legal team has cited some complaints from another major streaming service and has asked DEVFLIX to..."find a new look."

The marketing team thinks the current logo is angry, passionate, and full of emotion. However, they're curious about a few different directions you - the design team - could take this. They'd like to see three mock-ups:
- The first, they're calling __energetic__
- The second, they're calling __trippy__
- The third, they're calling __friendly__



## Deliverables 

 - [ ] Mock-up #1 <br />
 - [ ] Mock-up #2 <br />
 - [ ] Mock-up #3 <br />
